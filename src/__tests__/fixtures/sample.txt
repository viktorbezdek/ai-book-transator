This is a sample text for testing.
It contains multiple paragraphs and some character names like John Smith and Mary Johnson.
There's also some wordplay here: "Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana."

Another paragraph with different names: Professor White and Dr. Black are discussing quantum mechanics.
This text should be enough to test various translation scenarios.
